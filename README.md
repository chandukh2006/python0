# Python Calculator & Receipt Generator

## Overview

This project features a basic Python script designed to function as a calculator and receipt generator. It allows users to input prices for various items, calculates the total amount, and generates a simple receipt displaying the final bill. This tool is useful for basic financial calculations and generating a receipt for purchases.

## Features

- **Dynamic Calculation**: Continuously updates the total amount as item prices are entered.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Command-line interface that prompts users for item prices and displays the running total.
- **Receipt Generation**: Provides a final total and a thank-you message when the user decides to quit.
